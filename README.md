# Project Euler Solutions #1-100 (eventually)

Mostly just me trying to learn how to use C++. May at some point add solutions in other languages (probably Python).

## Hey you, read this:

I hope not to take away someone else's enjoyment out of solving these problems for themselves. That being said, there are thousands of other places that just give you the answer. 

Keeping this to the first 100 problems, as anything after that is not allowed to be discussed.
